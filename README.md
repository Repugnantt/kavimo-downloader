## NEWEST UPDATES:
After finding out about ramzali.com I could be sure about how platform works and made it so you can download videos from any website based on VIS ^2.0 and Kavimo

usage is fairly simple... -> every video is inside an iframe which can be incpected with devtools 

links examples are as following https://stream.biomaze.ir/i3zqz9fhf69f/iframe

in the link mentionded "HOST" is ( biomaze.ir ) and "ID" is ( i3zqz9fhf69f )

SIMPLE USAGE:

First time only (installation):

    git clone https://github.com/FarzadAT/kavimo-downloader.git
    cd kavimo-downloader
    pip install -r requirements.txt

using the application:

    py main.py

# **or on windows download and run the exe from:**

https://github.com/FarzadAT/kavimo-downloader/releases/download/release/kavimo-downloader.exe

**KEEP IN MIND THAT NO AUTHENTICATION TOKENS ARE REQUIRED AND YOUR PHONENUMBER IS REMOVED AUTOMATICALLY**







## OLD VERSION:

Works for biomaze.ir just because I couldnt find anymore sites hosted by kavimo

ALL VIDEOS ARE HOSTED AS IFRAMES e.g. "https://stream.biomaze.ir/i3zqz9fhf69f/iframe"

For above example the video id equals to "i3zqz9fhf69f"
better example would be "3r4w232sa3i7" which is not downloadable directly
